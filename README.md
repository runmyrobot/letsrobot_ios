# Let's Robot - iOS Client

Welcome to the Let's Robot (previously RunMyRobot) open source iOS application!

We're currently working towards the first version of the application and are aiming for mostly parity with the web version of the site. We have so many [ideas and plans](https://github.com/runmyrobot/letsrobot_ios/issues/72) and would love you to suggest yours!

After the initial release, and likely a round of testing, high on our agenda is to get a full testing suite and begin work on making the app usable by more people (incl. localization and tablet support)!

## Getting Started
1. Download Xcode (We currently use 8.2.1 as there is [a bug](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-4393) in more recent versions)
1. Clone the repository
1. Run the project!

All of our dependencies are stored in Git to allow you to get started as soon as possible!

## Contributing
Currently we're quite a small team, so we really appreciate any contributions whether it's just raising bugs via the [Issues](https://github.com/runmyrobot/letsrobot_ios/issues) tab or changes to the source code!

Please read our [contributing guide](https://github.com/runmyrobot/letsrobot_ios/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more!
