    <h3>Let’s Robot Together! </h1>
    <p>
        Here are a few simple guidelines to follow which we hope will make the experience better for everyone.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Dos</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Have fun and share control with other users</li>
        <li>Follow the rules set by the robocaster, if you don’t know them, ask!</li>
        <li>Remember the other humans and robots behind the screen</li>
        <li>Treat everyone with respect, especially the people on the robot stream. We want people to feel comfortable and safe around our robots.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Don'ts</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not exclude or bully someone else because of their race, sex, religion, disability, or any other reason.</li>
        <li>Do not insult or be rude to others.</li>
        <li>Do no harm any humans or animals. Please also avoid damaging robots or property, unless it’s explicitly part of the stream.</li>
        <li>Please do not post or share personal information about anyone on the site.</li>
        <li>Suggest or engage, or talk about engaging in illegal activities.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Unless the stream is marked as "mature"</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not talk about NSFW topics, or post links to nudity or extreme violence. </li>
        <li>Do not use derogatory language in chat.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Casters</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Please be encouraging, inclusive, and kind to all the viewers of your stream.</li>
        <li>Be sure to set clear rules and guidelines for how users should conduct themselves, and make sure they are clearly communicated in your channel description.</li>
        <li>Stream robots at your own risk. We are not responsible for any actions carried out by users, it is up to you to control the situation.</li>
        <li>Nudity is not allowed on any stream, and will result in an automatic ban.</li>
        <li>Intentionally putting the robot in a situation that will cause harm to other people, animals, or private property will also get you banned.</li>
        <li>Do not engage in illegal activities on stream, or put the robot in situations where they can also perform illegal activities.</li>
        <li>Intentionally spying on people without their knowledge or consent is also not acceptable.</li>
    </ul>
